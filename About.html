            <p>My name is Taylor Carrick.  I'm  currently a senior graduating in Fall of 2019 at MTSU with a B.S in Computer Science.  My love for computing started when I was very little and has only grown since. I currently live in Murfreesboro, Tennessee but, I don't mind traveling and love new experiences. Right now, I'm working on this website and have big plans for it.

            Currently, I am working for MTSU as a Lab Assistant, but previously I have worked for NTTData and FedEx.  I enjoy environments that are ever changing; where I am able to continue learning everyday.

            Outside of college, I am actively learning Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.  Studying Japanese has been a long journey, but one I'm willing to take.  I haven't been learning Chinese long, but I love seeing the comparisons between the two languages.
